# About

Bridge-In-Tech is an application inspired by the existing [AnitaB.org Mentorship System](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-backend/wiki). It encourages organizations to collaborate with the mentors and mentees on mentoring programs. Through Bridge-In-Tech, an organization can offer a mentorship program to a mentor and a mentee that is customised to meet the needed skills set within its organisation while providing a safety and supportive environment for these mentor/mentee to work in. This repository is the frontend of the system and it uses Reactjs. 

This project was proposed as [an original project of Google Summer of Code 2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4752039663370240/), by [Maya Treacy](https://github.com/mtreacy002). Maya is going to be mentored by [Ramit Sawhney](https://github.com/ramitsawhney27), [Meenakshi Dhanani](https://github.com/meenakshi-dhanani), [Foong Min Wong](https://github.com/foongminwong) and [Isabel Costa](https://github.com/isabelcosta). Isabel will also have a double role as the project manager. You can see Maya's [proposal here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZZCOoWdn2yb6N3qrrgK0SRDQPcx2Pp7kz3yDXDRSHUs/edit#heading=h.h1xuf6xi92mt).

The backend of this application will be a Python application using Flask and SQLAlchemy frameworks with PostgreSQL as the database. The link to the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/anitab-org/bridge-in-tech-backend).
