                        <h4>1. Purpose</h4>
                        <p>
                            A primary goal of AnitaB.org Open Source is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are
                            committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion
                            (or lack thereof). This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We
                            invite all those who participate in open source contributions to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.
                        </p>
                        <h4>2. Open Source Citizenship</h4>
                        <p>
                            A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our
                            actions and their effects on our community. Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality
                            and abuses of power that exist in society. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants
                            to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.
                        </p>
                        <h4>3. Expected Behavior</h4>
                        <p>
                            The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members: Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and
                            longevity of this community. Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions. Attempt collaboration before conflict. Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory,
                            or harassing behavior and speech. Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in
                            distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential. Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be
                            respectful to all patrons of these locations.
                        </p>
                        <h4>4. Unacceptable Behavior</h4>
                        <p>The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:</p>

                        <p>
                            Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable
                            behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to
                            and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).
                        </p>
                        <h4>6. Reporting Guidelines</h4>
                        <p>
                            If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community admin as soon as possible by emailing{" "}
                            <a href="mailto:opensource@anitab.org">opensource@anitab.org</a>. Please read{" "}
                            <a href="https://github.com/anitab-org/documentation/blob/master/Contributing/reporting_guidelines.md">Reporting Guidelines</a> for details. Additionally, community admins
                            are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of
                            in-person events, community admins (or event managers) will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

                            facilitate the product or service, facilitate communication, or otherwise execute the purpose for which the information was obtained in the first place. This means that
                            although much of the information can be deleted automatically (e.g. when you elect to unsubscribe from a newsletter), some will require manual review before doing so (e.g.
                            you have purchased a ticket for an event and we need some way to verify who you are in order to be admitted to the event). Tasks related to event organization and other
                            functions of AnitaB.org are performed both by employees, agents and contractors of AnitaB.org and by volunteers (“AnitaB.org Volunteers”) who are not employees. By making
                            use of the Site(s), you consent to allow AnitaB.org employees, agents, contractors, and AnitaB.org Volunteers to access any personal information you submit to the Site(s)
                            to provide AnitaB.org with a specific service and not for any other purpose. Additionally, AnitaB.org generally uses the information to operate, maintain, enhance, and
                            provide all of the features and services found on the Site(s). Under certain circumstances (for example if you win a contest) we may post your personal information on the
                            Site(s). However, we will notify you of this possibility when collecting personal information or we will obtain your consent to post this information. We may share your
                            personal information with certain other websites that we link to (and that you click upon) in order to achieve the purpose of the connection with the Site(s). AnitaB.org
                            may also use the information that we collect to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the way the Site(s) work and look, and to
                            create new features and functionality. The information may be stored and maintained for as long as reasonably necessary to effectuate the service requested and for a
                            reasonable time thereafter.

                        <p>
                            Non-identifiable data is information that subsequently is used in aggregate form or in a manner that does not readily identify an individual. We may collect

                            personal information, it does not identify you personally. AnitaB.org may share this type of non-identifiable data with a variety of third parties, including its

                        <h4>In the Event of Merger or Sale</h4>
                        <p>
                            In the event that AnitaB.org is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information
                            that we have collected from users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Third-Party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</h4>
                        <p>
                            The Site(s) may be linked to internet websites operated by other companies or third-party sponsors. Some of these websites may be co-branded with our name or logo, even
                            though they are not operated or maintained by us. AnitaB.org may also permit other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within
                            the Site(s). These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser, some of the advertisements and links that appear on the
                            Site(s). These advertisers may automatically receive your IP address if this happens. AnitaB.org may work with third parties (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook) who use
                            web beacons, pixel tags, JavaScript code, and other technologies to collect or receive information from our Site and elsewhere on the Internet and use that information to
                            provide measurement and conversion services and target advertisements. You may be able to opt-out of the collection and use of information for ad targeting by visiting
                            www.aboutads.info/choices or by enabling do-not-track settings in your browser if your browser provides those settings. You should consult the respective privacy policies
                            of these third-party websites and third party ad servers or ad networks. AnitaB.org’s privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other
                            third party advertisers or websites. Please be aware that AnitaB.org does not warn you when you have chosen to link through to another website from the Site(s).

                        <h4>Children</h4>
                        <p>
                            Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, the Sites are not intended for or directed to persons under the age of 13 and AnitaB.org
                            does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information on the Sites from persons under 13 years-of-age. Any person who provides their information to AnitaB.org through
                            any part of Site(s) represents to AnitaB.org that they are 13 years of age or older. If AnitaB.org learns that personal information of persons less than 13 years-of-age has
                            been collected on AnitaB.org without verifiable parental consent, then AnitaB.org will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or
                            guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to AnitaB.org, then you may alert AnitaB.org at Privacy@AnitaB.org and request
                            that AnitaB.org delete that child’s personal information from its systems.
