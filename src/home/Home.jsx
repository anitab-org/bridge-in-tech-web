        <p>Bridge-In-Tech is an application inspired by the existing
        AnitaB.org Mentorship System. It encourages organizations to collaborate
        with the mentors and mentees on mentoring programs. Through Bridge-In-Tech,
        an organization can offer a mentorship program to a mentor and a mentee that is customised
        to meet the needed skills set within its organisation while providing a safety and supportive
        environment for these mentor/mentee to work in.
