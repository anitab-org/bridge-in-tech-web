# Other ways to contribute

Do you know there are also other ways to contribute to the project besides working on an issue?
As contributors, you can also:

-   👀 **help review a PR** either by looking into the code and ensure that the code is clean and its logic makes sense. You can also run the app from PR branch to ensure the code works. Look for the PRs with `Status: Needs Review` label on the [Backend](https://github.com/anitab-org/bridge-in-tech-backend/pulls) and [Frontend](https://github.com/anitab-org/bridge-in-tech-web/pulls) repositories.
-   💻 **test a PR** by running it manually on your local machine and write a report on whether or not the PR works. Find a PR with `Status: Needs testing` label which is the next step after that PR is approved by the reviewer/s. Here're good examples of testing report done on one of the [backend](https://github.com/anitab-org/bridge-in-tech-backend/pull/71#pullrequestreview-445274875) and [frontend](https://github.com/anitab-org/bridge-in-tech-web/pull/62#pullrequestreview-464955571) PRs.
-   🔨 try to **break the app** by testing the application that runs from the existing code on the develop branch to find any bugs. If you find any, check if there is an issue already open for it, if there's none, report it on the [#bridge-in-tech](https://anitab-org.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/237630-bridge-in-tech) channel under `Bugs and Fixes` topic to ask if you can open one.
-   📚 **check documentations** and see if any area could be improved to help contributors understand the project better. If you find something, check if there is an issue already open for it, if there's none, report it on the [#bridge-in-tech](https://anitab-org.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/237630-bridge-in-tech) channel under `Documentation` topic to get approval to open an issue.
-   🎨 give suggestions on how to **improve the UI design**. Post your suggestion for a discussion on the [#bridge-in-tech](https://anitab-org.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/237630-bridge-in-tech) channel under `Design/Mocks` topic. You might get approval to work on your proposed design and have it implemented as the app UI 😁.

✨ Happy Coding !!! ✨
